  <h1>Yomio</h1>

  <p><strong>Learn Japanese vocabulary through reading, not flashcards.</strong></p>

  <p>
    Tired of flashcards?<br>
    Staring at word lists,<br>
    repeating the same cards,<br>
    memorizing today and forgetting tomorrow?
  </p>

  <p>
    Many Japanese learners face the same problems.
    Words are hard to remember.
    Studying feels boring and mechanical.
    Even if a word is memorized, it is difficult to recognize it in real sentences.
  </p>

  <h2>A different approach</h2>

  <p>
    Yomio takes a different approach.
  </p>

  <p>
    Instead of memorizing words in isolation, Yomio helps you learn Japanese vocabulary
    by reading meaningful context.
    Words are learned naturally by encountering them again and again in real usage.
  </p>

  <p>
    With Yomio, vocabulary is learned through simple tapping and reading.
  </p>

  <h2>How it works</h2>

  <p>
    Yomio keeps track of your learning status for each word.
    With just one tap, it selects words you are currently learning and generates
    a short paragraph at your level.
  </p>

  <p>
    You can choose different styles such as short stories, diaries, or news.
    After reading, you simply report whether the words felt familiar.
  </p>

  <p>
    Based on your feedback, Yomio automatically updates your learning progress
    and prepares the next reading for you.
    You do not need to manage anything yourself.
  </p>

  <h2>Learn naturally</h2>

  <p>
    By meeting words repeatedly in different contexts,
    you begin to recognize them faster and understand how they are actually used.
    Vocabulary gradually becomes more familiar without forcing yourself to memorize.
  </p>

  <p>
    Yomio is designed to be simple and calm.
    There are no endless flashcards and no complicated settings.
    You just tap, read, and let Yomio handle the rest.
  </p>

  <p>
    If you believe that language is learned through reading and real usage,
    not drills, Yomio is made for you.
